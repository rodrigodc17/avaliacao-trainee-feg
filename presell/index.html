          <h3>Elisa, 52</h3>
          <p>"I often felt tired and easily irritable. My husband and children sometimes didn't even recognize me, given my mood swings.</p>
          <p>If there's one thing I've realized, it's that we women greatly underestimate menopause, an immense physical and hormonal transformation, but many of us don't even seek minimal treatment.</p>
          <p>That's when I discovered Moonara, through social media and also through a friend who was taking it and becoming more radiant, beautiful, and happy with each passing day.</p>
          <p>It was no different for me. The capsules are like dreams, and your body feels like it's floating on clouds. It's an incredible feeling, and I can only thank the entire Moonara team for restoring my balance and rebuilding my femininity.</p>
          <p>When science and nature come together in the right way, it's impossible to go wrong!"</p>
